# GM-Editor
A level editor built in GameMaker for GameMaker. Designed to replace built in room editor

This is designed to run in an existing GameMaker project not standalone thanks to GameMaker not being able to load objects during runtime anymore.
Created because the built in editor is kind of crappy, so this is in the future is meant to be better.

Levels are saved in C:/Users/YourUser/AppData/Local/Levels/NameOfProjectThatThisIsEmbededIn


-------TODO LIST-------
Transformation of objects,
Bucket fill and line fill,
Tiles support,
Views support,
Proper room properties changing and saving.
